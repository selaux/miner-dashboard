Step 1: Clone the repository or [download the current version](https://github.com/selaux/miner-dashboard/releases) and extract it.

```
git clone https://github.com/selaux/miner-dashboard.git
```

Step 2: Copy example configuration

```
cd miner-dashboard
mv config/config.example.js config/config.js
```

Step 3: Adapt `config/config.js` to match your mining setup. The [Module List](https://github.com/selaux/miner-dashboard#modules) to shows available modules and how they are set up.

Step 4: Start the application

```
npm start
```

Step 5: Visit url and check if everything works.

```

## Run with Docker

```docker run -t -i --rm -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/your/config.js:/app/config/config.js:ro  selaux/miner-dashboard:latest```

Make sure you make the dashboard listen to port 3000 in your configuration or adapt the docker port forwarding to your liking.

In most docker installations you can reference the host by using the ip ```172.17.42.1```in your configuration.
